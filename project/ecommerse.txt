jsonwebtoken
"When a user logs in to the website, their credentials (such as email and password)
 are verified by the server.
 userSchema.methods.getJWTToken = function () {
    return jwt.sign({ id: this._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
        expiresIn: process.env.JWT_EXPIRE
    })
} 
 If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT token 
 containing the user's information (e.g., user ID, role) and sends it back to the client
 This token is then stored in the localStorage or sessionStorage or cookies at client side".
 if we want to give access to specific route only when the user is authenticate in such case we can use the jwt token 
 stored in a cookies. we can use this token to verify the user id valid or not.
 we just need to use jwt.verify and pass th token and jwt secret key then we will get the information of user if it is valid user
 depending on this we can evaluate that user is authenticated or not. 

const decodesData = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET)


nodemailer
Nodemailer is a popular Node.js library used for sending emails from your applications.
It allows you to send both plain text and HTML emails through various email services (like Gmail, Outlook,
custom SMTP servers (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

// 1. Import the nodemailer package
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// 2. Create a transporter (this is your email service configuration)
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail', // You can use other email services like 'hotmail', 'yahoo', etc.
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@gmail.com',  // Your email
    pass: 'your-email-password'    // Your email password (or app-specific password for Gmail)
  }
});

// 3. Set up the email options
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your-email@gmail.com',  // Sender's email
  to: 'recipient@example.com',   // Receiver's email
  subject: 'Test Email',         // Email subject
  text: 'Hello, this is a test email from Nodemailer!',  // Plain text content
  // html: '<p>Hello, <strong>this is a test email</strong> from Nodemailer!</p>' // Optional HTML content
};

// 4. Send the email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
  }
});
