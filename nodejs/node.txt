1. what is nodejs ?
:=> Node.js is an open source server environment. 

==============================================================_____***_____==============================================================

2. What is non-blocking vs blocking?
=> In Node.js, blocking and non-blocking behavior is determined by how I/O operations are handled.


         Non blocking                                                              Blocking
                                                                            
 By default, Node.js uses a non-blocking                                        Blocking behavior can occur when using
 I/O model, where I/O operations are performed                                  certain synchronous I/O methods in Node.js. 
 asynchronously without blocking the main thread                                which have names that end with Sync
 of execution.  

This means that when an I/O operation is executed,                              Synchronous methods block the main thread until
the program continues to execute other tasks while                              the operation is completed, preventing the program 
waiting for the I/O operation to complete.                                      from executing any other tasks until the operation is finished.

 All of the I/O methods in the Node.js standard library provide asynchronous versions,
 which are non-blocking, and accept callback functions. 
 Some methods also have blocking counterparts, which have names that end with Sync.

Blocking methods execute synchronously and non-blocking methods execute asynchronously.

Eg. const fs = require('node:fs');
    const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read


    const fs = require('node:fs');
    fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
  })

 * difference between synchrounous function and asynchronous functions.

3. What is throughput?
:=> rate at which a system can process a certain amount of work within a given amount of time.
    it is important in determining the overall efficiency and effectiveness of a system.

4. what is the difference between readFile and readFileSync
:=> readFile is an asynchronous function in Node.js that is used for reading the contents of a file.
    readFileSync is a synchronous version of readFile. It is a blocking function, meaning that 
    it will block the execution of the program until the file reading operation is complete.


5. How can you make a network request using http module?

6. How to create a web server without express?
:=> 
we can create a basic web server in Node.js without using Express by using the "built-in http module".
Here's a simple example:-


const http = require('http');

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response header
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});

  // Write the response body
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

// Specify the port and IP address to listen on
const PORT = 3000;
const IP = '127.0.0.1';

// Start the server
server.listen(PORT, IP, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${IP}:${PORT}/`);
});


7.What is libuv?
:=> Node.js utilizes libuv to achieve its non-blocking and asynchronous characteristics.
    When you see discussions about the event loop, non-blocking I/O, and concurrency in 
    the context of Node.js, it often involves the underlying support provided by libuv.

8. What are the different phases involved in event loop?
:=> The event loop in Node.js consists of several phases, each responsible for different types of tasks. 
1. Timers Phase:-

This phase handles the callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval() functions.
It executes the callbacks whose timers have expired.

2. I/O Callbacks Phase:-
    In this phase, callbacks from I/O events, like network or file system operations, are processed.
   When a task related to I/O completes, its callback is pushed to the event queue to be executed in this phase.

3. Idle, Prepare Phases:-
    The idle phase allows Node.js to execute callbacks during periods of idle time, 
    and the prepare phase is used for preparing resources for I/O callbacks.

4. Poll Phase:
This is the main phase where the event loop blocks and waits for events to occur.
If there are callbacks in the poll queue, they are executed immediately.
If the poll queue is empty, the event loop will wait for events to occur.

5. Check Phase:-
This phase is executed after the poll phase if the poll queue becomes empty and new events are added during the poll phase.
The check phase executes callbacks registered with setImmediate().

6. Close Callbacks Phase:-
This phase executes callbacks registered with close events, such as those in socket.on('close', ...).



9.What are timers in Node.js?
:=> in Node.js, timers are mechanisms that allow you to schedule the execution of functions or
 code at a specified time in the future or after a certain interval.

 setTimeout(callback, delay[, ...args]):

setTimeout is used to execute a callback function after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
setInterval is used to repeatedly execute a callback function at fixed intervals.


10. What is NVM? how do you use it?
:=> In Node.js, "NVM" stands for Node Version Manager. 
    It's a tool that allows you to manage multiple Node.js installations on your machine, 
    making it easy to switch between different Node.js versions for different projects. 

11. What is common.js? how is it different from es modules?
CommonJS is a module system for JavaScript that is used primarily in server-side environments, 
such as Node.js. It allows developers to organize code into separate files, called modules, and then 
import and use those modules in other parts of the code. CommonJS uses the require function to import
modules and module.exports to export values from a module.

 // math.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
module.exports = add;


// main.js
const add = require('./math');
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5


 ES Modules (ECMAScript Modules) is the official module system for JavaScript as standardized in
 ECMAScript 6 (ES6). ESM is designed to work both in browsers and in server-side environments like Node.js.
 It uses import and export statements to define dependencies and expose functionality between modules.

  // math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// main.js
import { add } from './math';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5


12. How does the crypto module work?*
:=> The crypto module in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality. It offers a set of cryptographic operations,
 including hash functions, HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), encryption, and decryption.

13. What are web sockets?*
:=>  They are particularly useful for building applications requiring instant updates,
     such as real-time chat, messaging, and multiplayer games.

    Unlike traditional HTTP, which is based on a request-response model, WebSockets allow
    for bidirectional communication, enabling real-time data transfer.

14. What are microservices?*
:=> It's a software architecture approach that breaks down complex applications into independent components.
 These individual components interact with each other through well-defined APIs to provide efficient functionality.
