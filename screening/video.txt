                                           opportunity to share a
                                           bit about myself and

                                           i am from orange city 
                                           i.e Nagpur, I embarked 
                                           on my educational journey
                                           at GHRP Nagpur, where I
                                           completed my diploma in 
                                           Mechanical Engineering. 
                                           Later,I pursued a degree
                                           in Mechanical Engineering at RTMNU.

                                           To fuel my interest in 
                                           cutting-edge technology, 
                                           I recently completed a 
                                           MERN Stack Development
                                           course at Masai School 
                                           Bengaluru. This intensive
                                           program equipped me with 
                                           expertise in MongoDB, Express.js,
                                           React.js, and Node.js.

                                          During my academic journey, 
                                          I had the privilege of working
                                          on exciting projects. I built
                                          a clone of shop.com, clone of 
                                          expendia.com, and clone of koo 
                                          application. 
                                          These experiences have honed my
                                          skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                                          and React.js.

                                         "Beyond the code, my passions 
                                          include playing cricket and
                                          finding solace in spiritual songs. 

                                          i believe i am self motivated
