Hello,
My name is Shubham Gorle, and I am a recent graduate based in Nagpur with a Diploma in Mechanical 
Engineering from GHRP and a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Mechanical Engineering from RTMNU.
I have also completed a rigorous MERN Stack Development course at Masai School, Bengaluru, 
where I gained proficiency in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. While I do not have
prior professional experience, I have undertaken projects during my studies, including building
clones of shop.com and Expedia using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a clone of the Koo
application using React.js. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute 
effectively in a MERN stack development role. I am actively seeking opportunities to kick-start
my career in software development and would welcome the chance to discuss how I can add value to your team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

2. What’s the biggest misconception your coworkers/colleagues have about you and why do they think that? 
:=> During my time at Masai School, I participated in three group projects. We were given a time limit 
of four days to complete the projects. However, some of the group members were slow in their work, and it
 seemed impossible for us to complete the project before the deadline. During a group meeting, I expressed
  my frustration and urged them to complete the work quickly. Unfortunately, my tone came across as arrogant, 
  and they think that I was not a good person. This was a misconception, as I am a good person, but I wanted to 
  ensure that we completed the project on time. In a professional setting, sometimes we have to make tough decisions, 
  and I believe that my behavior was acceptable given the circumstances.

3. What’s the most interesting thing about you that’s not on your resume? 
:=> I am a spiritual person who believes in God and karma. Whenever something bad happens to me unexpectedly, most people would lose hope and become demotivated. However, during such times, spirituality always helps me. It reminds me that whatever happens in my life is with the wish of God, and it is for my own good. If I keep this attitude, it will be responsible for my success.

4. Describe the best partner or supervisor with whom you’ve worked. What part of their managing style appealed to you? What characteristics are you looking for in a supervisor/manager? *
:=> During my time at Masai School, I was part of a group project. One of my colleagues in the group was named shubhi. She was incredibly hardworking and passionate about her work. Whenever she got stuck at any point in the project, she would reach out to me and humbly ask for my help. I always appreciated her willingness to learn and improve, and I was happy to assist her in any way I could. 

5. What are your biggest strengths? What are your biggest weaknesses?
:=> My greatest strength is my ability to work well with others. Throughout my time at Masai School, I have worked on three projects, each with a team of four people. I am confident that my team members had no complaints about my work.
    Public speaking makes me nervous, although I don't necessarily need it for my role as a MERN stack developer, I still believe it's an important skill to have. Especially when I want to offer my opinions in meetings or group discussions. I'm aware of this weakness and I'm actively working on overcoming it.

6. How would your manager describe you? Now tell me, how would your best friend describe you?
:=> If you were to ask my best friend how they would describe me, I believe they would say that I am dependable and empathetic. They know that I am someone they can rely on, both personally and professionally. For instance, when a friend was going through a tough time, I made sure to be there to listen and offer support, which I think reflects my compassionate nature.
I think my best friend would also describe me as someone who brings a positive energy to any situation. I tend to see the bright side of things and try to motivate and uplift those around me. This positivity translates into my work as well, where I strive to foster a collaborative and encouraging environment.
Overall, I believe my best friend would describe me as someone who is genuine, caring, and always willing to go the extra mile to help others succeed.

7. What are the three things that are most important to you in a job? 
:=> If I were to identify the three things that are most important to me in a job, first one would be, 
Opportunities for Growth and Learning: I am committed to continuously improving my skills and knowledge. Therefore, I value a job that provides opportunities for professional development, whether through training programs, mentorship, or challenging projects that allow me to expand my expertise.
second one would be, Positive Work Environment and Company Culture: It's important for me to work in a supportive and collaborative environment where teamwork is valued, and employees are respected. A positive company culture fosters employee engagement and satisfaction, which ultimately leads to better outcomes.
third one would be, Alignment with Values and Impact: I seek a job that aligns with my values and allows me to make a meaningful impact. Whether it's contributing to a larger mission, serving customers, or creating innovative solutions, I want to feel that my work has significance and adds value to the organization.
These three factors are essential to me because they not only contribute to my job satisfaction but also enable me to thrive professionally and contribute effectively to the success of the team and company.

8. What is your current CTC (per annum) in INR? 
:=> I am currently unemployed and actively seeking employment opportunities.
