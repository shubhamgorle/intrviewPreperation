#what is the main difference between html and html5 ?
:=> it is the new version of the html which is added like Semantic tags.

# What does CSS stand for?
:=> Cascading Style Sheets.

# What does HTML stand for?
:=> Hypertext Markup Language.

# What are the features of HTML5?
:=> Audio support, video support, form validation, Geolocation API,
    local Storage, Responsive Images, header, footer, placeholder attribute in input element, email attribute.

# What are the different types of storage in HTML5?
:=> The two storages are session storage and local storage and they would be used to handle different situations.
Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies.

# difference btween local storage and session storage ?
:=> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, the difference is that data
    in localStorage doesn't expire while data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

# What are forms in HTML?
:=> An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing. 

# What are event listeners in HTML? 
:=> In HTML, event listeners are a way to handle user interactions or actions 
    that occur on a webpage. They are 'used to detect' when a specific event happens,
    such as a button click, mouse movement, keyboard input, or the loading of a webpage,
    and then execute a function or a series of instructions in response to that event.

                                                                    

<body onload="myFunction()">
  <!-- Rest of the HTML content -->
</body>

<script>
  function myFunction() {
    // Code to be executed when the page loads
    alert('Page loaded!');
  }
</script>

# What is scroll event?
:=> 
 The scroll event is an event in HTML that occurs when the user scrolls
 the content of a webpage or a scrollable element. It allows you to detect and 
 respond to scroll-related actions, such as scrolling up, scrolling down, or scrolling to a specific position on the page.

<div id="myDiv" onscroll="myFunction()">
  <!-- Scrollable content -->
</div>

<script>
  function myFunction() {
    // Code to be executed when scrolling occurs
    console.log('Scrolling...');
  }
</script>

# How do you know if a user is offline or not? What API does the browser provide for that? 
:=> We can detect if the user is online or offline by using the online property on the navigator
 object which will return true if the user is connected to the internet, otherwise it returns false.

 if(navigator.onLine){
    console.log("online")
}else{
    console.log("offline")
}

# How do you use Video and Audio tags?
:=> 1.
<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
To embed a video on your web page, you can use the <video> tag.
In the above example, the src attribute specifies the URL or file path of the video file. 
The controls attribute adds playback controls (play/pause, volume, etc.) to the video player.
You can also provide alternative video sources using the <source> element within the <video> tag.
This allows the browser to choose the appropriate video source based on its supported formats.
Here's an example:

<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
</video>

 In this example, the browser will try to play the video.mp4 file first. If it's not supported,
 it will fallback to the video.webm file. The text "Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video." 
 is displayed only if the browser doesn't support any of the provided video formats.

2.
To embed audio on your web page, you can use the <audio> tag.
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls></audio>

Similar to the <video> tag, the src attribute specifies the URL or file path of the audio file. 
The controls attribute adds playback controls to the audio player.
You can also include multiple audio sources using the <source> element
within the <audio> tag to provide fallback options for different audio formats.

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.
</audio>

In this example, the browser will attempt to play the audio.mp3 file first,
and if not supported, it will fallback to the audio.ogg file.
The fallback text is displayed if the browser doesn't support any of the provided audio formats.


1. What is HTML?
=> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

2. What is the purpose of HTML tags?
=> HTML tags are used to "define and structure the content" on a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs.

3. What is the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration?patterns
=> The DOCTYPE declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML used in the document.
   It helps browsers to render the web page correctly.


4. What is the difference between <div> and <span>?
=> <div> is a block-level element used for grouping and structuring content.
<span> is an inline element used for applying styles to a specific part of the text.
 

5. What are semantic elements in HTML?
=>Semantic elements provide meaning to both the browser and the developer. 
Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>, 

6. Explain the difference between inline and block-level elements.
=> Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, 
while inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag?
=> The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded. It is also used for accessibility.

colspan ---> To make a cell span more than one column
rowspan ---> To make a cell span more than one row

Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!


# ------------------------------------- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)------------------------------------- #


# What are CSS selectors?
:=> CSS selectors are used to select and target specific elements in an HTML document.
Here are some commonly used CSS selectors: 

1. Element Selector: Targets elements based on their tag names. For example, p targets all <p> elements.

2. Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute value. It is denoted with a dot (.) followed by the class name.
 For example, .my-class targets all elements with class="my-class".

3. ID Selector: Targets a specific element with a "unique ID attribute value".
 It is denoted with a hash (#) followed by the ID name. For example, #my-id targets the element with id="my-id".

4. Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes. For example, [type="text"] targets all elements with type="text".
https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_attribute

5.Descendant Selector: Targets elements that are descendants of another element. It is denoted by a space between two selectors. 
For example, ul li targets all <li> elements that are descendants of <ul> elements.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_element_element

6. Child Selector: Targets elements that are direct children of another element. It is denoted by the > symbol between two selectors. 
For example, div > p targets all <p> elements that are direct children of <div> elements.
   https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_element_gt

7. A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specific parts of an element
Style the first letter or line, of an element
Insert content before or after an element

8. A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.


# What are CSS variables? 
:=> allow you to define reusable values in CSS. They are similar to variables in programming languages,
 as they can store values and be referenced throughout the stylesheet.

 CSS variables are declared using the -- prefix followed by a name and an optional value.
  For example:

:root{
  --primary-color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}


# What is Box Model ?
:=> The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that
    describes how elements are rendered and how their dimensions
    and spacing are calculated. It consists of four main components: 
    content, padding, border, and margin. These components create a box around an element.

    
# What is a flex-box?
Flexbox, also known as Flexible Box Layout, it provides an efficient 
way to arrange and align elements within a container. 
It is designed to handle the distribution 
of available space among the items in a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic. 

# what are grids?
:=> grid is a layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive
    page layouts by dividing the content into rows and columns.
    

 fr ---> fractional unit

 # What are the differences between Flex and Grids?
 :=>              Grids                                                       Flex 
 Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts                 ||  The main purpose of Flexbox is to create one-dimensional layouts.
 allowing you to create both rows and columns simultaneously. ||  allowing you to create either in a row (horizontal) or in a column (vertical).


# what is Specificity ?
:=> Specificity is a concept in CSS that determines which styles should be applied to an HTML
    element when multiple conflicting CSS rules target the same element. It defines the order of
    precedence for CSS rules based on their specificity value.        

Inline styles: 1,000 (highest specificity)
IDs: 100
Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes: 10
Elements and pseudo-elements: 1 (lowest specificity)

# What are media queries?
:=> Media queries are a fundamental feature of responsive web design in CSS. 
    They allow you to apply different styles to a web page based on various device characteristics.

# what is z-index?
:=> The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.  
    An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Note : => z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) 
          and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).


# display:none ---> will hide element an space both 
  visibility:hidden ---> will hide the element but show the empty space 


# what is the difference between display inline, block, inline-block
:=>
display: inline -> default for span tag. -> width, height, paddding, margin are not respected -> -> does not add line break
display: inline-block -> width height paddding margin are respected -> does not add line break
display: block        -> width height paddding margin are respected  -> add line break
ex. 
https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_inline-block_span1

# difference between position absolute, relative, fixed and sticky.
:=> position static : default
 
    position absolute :- position the element relative to the position of its first parent div.

    position relative :- position the element relative to its normal position.

    position fixed    :- position the element relative to its browser window.

    position sticky   :- it will stick when it will reached to top of the page. top should be 0 only.


# justify content, justifySelf, justifyItems.
:=> justify-items - Aligns the content inside a grid(box) item along the row axis (it is available in grid only not in Flexbox)

justify-content - This property aligns the grid along the row axis

justify-self - Aligns the content inside a grid item along the row axis and it override the properties of

justify item and justify content (it is available in grid only not in Flexbox).
