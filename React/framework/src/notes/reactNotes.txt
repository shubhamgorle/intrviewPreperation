# what is react ?

it is build by jordan walke.

# what is library?
:=> it is a collection of pre-defined function or casses or properties 
eg. React, redux, react-router-dom.

# what is framework?
:=> framework is collection of libraries and set of rules to develpe an application.
 eg. angular, Vue JS, backbone js.

# why react ?
:=> 

# what is jsx ?
:=>  JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
 In JSX rather than writing React.createElement we write plane HTML inside our JS itself.
 This makes our code much more readable and removes unnecessary complexity. 

There are tools like babel which converts our JSX code to simple React.createElement code.
So Babel will convert our above JSX code to React.createElement code and then it is rendered in the webpage.

# What is the difference between State and Props?
:=> It is used to store information that can change over time and trigger a re-rendering of the component when it does.
    and Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
Parent components pass data to child components by adding attributes to the child component's JSX tag,
 and the child component can access the passed data through its props object.

 # What is Conditional Rendering?
 :=> Components can render different content based on the values stored in their state. When the state changes, 
 React automatically triggers a re-render, and the component will display different content accordingly.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome back!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}
      <button onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(!isLoggedIn)}>
        {isLoggedIn ? 'Log Out' : 'Log In'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
