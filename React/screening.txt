1. Tell me about yourself
:=> 
Good afternoon Sir.
i am shubham gorle from orange city i.e nagpur.
about my  education, i have completed diploma in mechanical engineering form GHRP nagpur and BE in mechanical engineering from RTMNU.
i have also completed MERN STACK developement course from masai school, bengluru.
I specialize in the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
During my studies, I worked on a project that involved building a clone of shop.com, clone of expendia using html, css and javascript and clone 
of Koo application using React js. 
my hobbies are to playing cricket and listnining spritual song as wel.
I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise and learn from the experienced team at your company.
Thank you for considering me as a potential addition to your team.


2. What prompted you to pursue a career in mern stack developement ?
:=> 

when i was in final year of graduation i had an idea on which i wanted to build a project which was related to computer 
science and i did not able to build it bcz i did not familier with the tech stack which is required to build that project.
but i wanted to learn the tech stack which is required for building that application.
to be very honest there was very limited job opportunities ans slow carrier growth in mechanical feild. 
thats why i choosen mern stack developer as a carrier.

3. why you shift your carrier from mechanical enginnering to computer science ?
:=>
after completion of graduation i discuss with my seniors about jobs availability in feild of mechanical enginnering.
and they told me they wanted to shift their carrier from mechanical to IT due to slow carrier growth.
then i think after having experice of 2-3 yrs in core feild they are shifting their carrier then i should not waste time in 
trying someting because a great man says you should learn from other's mistakes. thats why i choosen mern stack developer as a carrier. 
 
 
4 what is your strength ?
:=> 
My gretest strenth i would like to say i am peoples person, i enjoy working in teams. during my masai school journey i have worked on three 
projects in a team of 4 peoples for each project and i don't think they have complaints against me.


5. what is your weakness ?
:=>
public speaking makes me nervous Althught i don't need public speaking for my role as a mern stack developer but i still thing it is important
skill, especially when i want to offer up my opinions in meetings or group discussions and i am working on this weakness to overcome it.
