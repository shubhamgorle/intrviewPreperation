1. Tell me about yourself
:=> 
Good evening mam.
i am shubham gorle from orange city i.e nagpur.
about my  education, i have completed diploma in mechanical engineering form GHRP nagpur and BE in mechanical engineering from RTMNU.
i have also completed MERN STACK developement course from masai school bengluru.
I specialize in the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
During my studies, I worked on a project that involved building a clone of shop.com, clone of expendia using html, css and javascript and clone 
of Koo application using React js. 
I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise and learn from the experienced team at MsCorpres Automation Private Limited.
Thank you for considering me as a potential addition to your team.
I bring not only technical proficiency but also excellent teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills.

2. What prompted you to pursue a career in mern stack developement ?
:=> 
when i was in final year of graduation i had an idea on which i wanted to build a project which was related to computer 
science and i did not able to build it bcz i did not familier with the tech stack which is required to build that project.
but i wanted to learn the tech stack which is required for building that application.
after completion of graduation to be very honest there was very limited job opportunities ans slow carrier growth in mechanical feild. then i 
that why i choosen mern stack developer as a carrier.

4. what is your strength ?
:=> 
My gretest strenth i would like to say i am peoples person, i enjoy working in teams. during my masai school journey i have worked on three 
projects in a team of 4 peoples for each project and i dont think they have complaints against me.
second one is i am quick learner because of that i am able to shift my carrier from mechanical engineering to computer science in very limited period
of time.

5. what is your weakness ?
:=>
public speaking makes me nervous Althught i don't need public speaking for my role as a mern stack developer but i still thing it is important
skill, especially when i want to offer up my opinions in meetings or group discussions and i am working on this weakness to overcome it.

3. Why do you want to work here specifically?
